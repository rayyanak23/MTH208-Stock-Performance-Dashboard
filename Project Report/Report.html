<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In the dynamic and intricate world of financial markets, making informed investment decisions is crucial for maximizing returns and managing risks.

<h1>Unlocking The Data</h1>
<p>Embarking on this stock analysis journey, we’ve chosen a substantial timeframe, ranging from <strong>August 2016 to September 2023</strong>. During this period, we’re closely examining the monthly data of key players such as <strong>JSW Steel, INFOSYS, HDFC Bank, and TCS</strong>, juxtaposed against the benchmark index, <strong>BSE SENSEX</strong>.</p>
<section id="key-variables" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-variables">Key Variables</h2>
<p>Within our dataset lies a set of pivotal variables that hold the secrets of market movements. These variables, fundamental to our analysis making it easier for us to decode the intricate dance of financial markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OPEN</strong>: Represents the opening price of a stock on a given trading day.</li>
<li><strong>CLOSE</strong>: Indicates the closing price of a stock on a specific trading day.</li>
<li><strong>ADJ CLOSE</strong>: Reflects the closing price adjusted for corporate actions such as dividends and stock splits.</li>
<li><strong>HIGH</strong>: Denotes the highest price at which a stock traded during a specific trading day.</li>
<li><strong>LOW</strong>: Represents the lowest price at which a stock traded during a specific trading day.</li>
<li><strong>VOLUME</strong>: Total number of shares traded for a specific stock on a given trading day.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>
<p>The data utilized for this analysis has been extracted from Yahoo Finance (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com" class="uri">https://finance.yahoo.com</a>) through the application of the <strong>rvest</strong> package in the R programming language.</p>

<section id="data-cleaning-and-preprocessing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-cleaning-and-preprocessing">Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h2>
<p>The scraped data, upon extraction, does not align directly for analytical purposes, given that a substantial portion of numerical observations is stored as character data. Additionally, the presence of commas in the numeric values necessitates preprocessing before conducting any meaningful analysis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the dataset contains certain untidy observations within the table, requiring additional efforts for cleaning and data refinement before it can be effectively utilized for analysis</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-extraction-and-inclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-extraction-and-inclusion">Feature Extraction And Inclusion</h2>
<p>As part of the feature extraction process, a column expressing percentage changes has been introduced, facilitating a direct comparison of stock values. Additionally, certain financial metrics, intrinsic to the analysis, have been manually incorporated into the dataset. This step was necessary as the information pertaining to these metrics could not be directly scraped and computed from the available data.</p>

<p>For expeditious examination of historical stock prices, a candlestick chart has been generated. This visual representation offers a concise overview of price movements over time. In a candlestick chart, each ‘candle’ comprises four key elements: the opening price, closing price, highest price (wick or upper shadow), and lowest price (wick or lower shadow). The body of the candle, typically colored, signifies the price range between opening and closing, with green indicating an upward movement and red indicating a downward movement.</p>

<p>The stock has exhibited considerable positive growth in recent years. However, a noteworthy observation arises when comparing the length of each candlestick before and after 2020. The discernible increase in post-2020 volatility can be attributed to significant global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine-Russia war, and a global recession. These geopolitical and economic factors have played pivotal roles in influencing trader sentiments, contributing to heightened market uncertainty and more pronounced price fluctuations during these impactful periods.</p>

<p>The trajectory of stock growth has been ambiguous, with a consistent increase from 2016 to 2019, followed by a sudden decline. However, the stock displayed exceptional growth in 2020 and mid-2021. The dynamics of these fluctuations pose challenges in understanding the influencing factors.</p>

<p>As discerned from the candlestick chart, the annual returns of the stock display a consistent pattern, featuring escalating returns until 2018, succeeded by an abrupt decline. Noteworthy is the exceptional growth observed in 2020 and 2021, while 2022 reveals a return to more moderate performance, and as of the present data, the trajectory for 2023 remains undetermined.</p>
<p>The depicted movement in both charts lacks conclusive evidence about the stock’s overall performance, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions</p>

<p>The first, second, and third quartiles (Q1, Q2, and Q3) exhibit positive median returns, with Q2 displaying more outliers. This phenomenon is potentially attributed to the significant surge in stock prices between 2020 and 2021. The definitive cause for such a substantial jump cannot be ascertained due to the unpredictable trajectory of the stock. The unpredictable nature of its movement makes it challenging to pinpoint specific factors leading to the observed surge</p>

<p>In the overarching assessment, the chosen cohort of companies has outperformed the general market trend. Notably, JSW Steel stands out as the top performer, yielding returns exceeding 300% over the past six years. Conversely, Infosys emerges as the least robust performer within our portfolio, generating a return of 150%, which closely aligns with the overall market return. It is imperative to acknowledge that the impressive performance of JSW Steel is accompanied by heightened volatility compared to other stocks and the overall market.</p>

<p>The post-COVID era has witnessed a positive impact on the monthly returns of JSW Steel, Infosys, and TCS. However, it is noteworthy that HDFC Bank, during the same period, reflects a negative return. Various factors contributing to this discrepancy may include sector-specific challenges, economic uncertainties, and distinct market positioning strategies employed by HDFC Bank in response to the evolving financial landscape</p>

<h1>Concluding Remarks</h1>
<p>In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of stock performance, encompassing JSW Steel, Infosys, HDFC Bank, and TCS, along with the benchmark index BSE SENSEX, has provided valuable insights. The project highlighted distinctive trends in returns, volatility, and reactions to significant events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic tensions. JSW Steel emerged as a standout performer, showcasing substantial returns albeit accompanied by higher volatility. Infosys exhibited steady growth, HDFC Bank faced challenges resulting in a negative return, and TCS demonstrated resilience.</p>
<p>Upon comprehensive analysis, it is discerned that technology and consulting firms exhibit consistent and robust growth, maintaining a relatively stable trajectory. In contrast, other stocks appear more volatile in comparison. It is imperative to note, however, that the sample collected may not be representative of each sector in the market. Consequently, drawing definitive conclusions is challenging, but based on the available data, these observations hold true.</p>
<p>The observed variability in stock prices is not solely dictated by isolated elements but rather by the collective impact of numerous dynamic variables. These encompass economic indicators, global geopolitical events, and sentiments triggered by news and phenomena, collectively shaping the intricate and often unpredictable dynamics of the market. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of these influences is imperative for a comprehensive understanding of stock behavior and for formulating well-informed investment strategies.</p>
